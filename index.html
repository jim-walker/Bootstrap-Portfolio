                <p>I have a 25-year career as an IT professional where I have been a system admin, system analyst, and system architect which demonstrates a habit of choosing roles that start with the letter a and are always accompanied the adjective ‘system’.</p>
                <p>I have been married 30 years….to the same woman.  I am father to 4 children, who are beginning to come to that point in life where they slowly realize I am not going to keep paying for everything.</p>
                <p>My favorite hobby is doing genealogical research which for a long time consisted of rummaging through forgotten libraries( a place where physical books can still be found ) and taking long walks though old cemeteries.  But recently I have been busy putting the new tool of DNA analysis to work in solving family mysteries.</p>
